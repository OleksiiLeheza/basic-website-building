      Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by Steve
      Wozniak, Steve Jobs (1955â€“2011) and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell
      Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and
      Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977. The company's second computer,
      the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced
      microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success.
      The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user
      interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in
      a critically acclaimed advertisement called "1984". By 1985, the high cost
      of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems.
      Wozniak stepped back from Apple and pursued other ventures, while Jobs
      resigned and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.

    <h3  >Early Years (1976-1984)</h3>
    In a garage in Cupertino, California, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created the first Apple computer, the Apple
    I. They sold it as a DIY kit and later introduced the Apple II, which was the first personal computer to feature
    color graphics. Apple went public in 1980, generating significant revenue and becoming a major player in the

    <h3>Lisa and Macintosh Era (1984-1991)</h3>
    In 1984, Apple introduced the Macintosh, a groundbreaking computer with a graphical user interface and a mouse.
    It revolutionized the industry but faced internal struggles, leading to Jobs' departure in 1985. The following

    <h3>Turbulent Times (1991-1997)</h3>

    <h3>Renaissance and the iPod (1998-2006)</h3>

    design icon and revived Apple's fortunes. In 2001, Apple introduced the iPod, a portable digital music player
    that revolutionized the music industry. It was followed by iTunes, an online music store, which became immensely
    popular.</p>
