    <p >
      Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by Steve
      Wozniak, Steve Jobs (1955–2011) and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell
      Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and
      Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977. The company's second computer,
      the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced
      microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success.
      The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user
      interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in
      a critically acclaimed advertisement called "1984". By 1985, the high cost
      of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems.
      Wozniak stepped back from Apple and pursued other ventures, while Jobs
      resigned and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.

    <h2 >History</h2>
    <p  >Apple Inc. is a technology company that was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and
        Ronald Wayne. It is now one of the world's leading technology companies, specializing in consumer
        electronics, software development, and online services. Here is a brief history of the company</p>
    </p><br>
 <p  >
    <h3  >Early Years (1976-1984)</h3>
    In a garage in Cupertino, California, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created the first Apple computer, the Apple
    I. They sold it as a DIY kit and later introduced the Apple II, which was the first personal computer to feature
    color graphics. Apple went public in 1980, generating significant revenue and becoming a major player in the
    emerging personal computer industry.</p><br>
 <p >
    <h3>Lisa and Macintosh Era (1984-1991)</h3>
    In 1984, Apple introduced the Macintosh, a groundbreaking computer with a graphical user interface and a mouse.
    It revolutionized the industry but faced internal struggles, leading to Jobs' departure in 1985. The following
    years saw the release of the Macintosh Portable and the Macintosh II, but Apple faced increasing competition and
    declining sales.</p><br>
    <p>
    <h3>Turbulent Times (1991-1997)</h3>
    Throughout the 1990s, Apple experienced various challenges, including leadership changes, declining market share,
    and unsuccessful product launches. However, in 1997, Apple acquired NeXT Computer, bringing Steve Jobs back to the
    company as an advisor.</p><br>
 <p>
    <h3>Renaissance and the iPod (1998-2006)</h3>
    Jobs became Apple's interim CEO and initiated a significant turnaround. The iMac, released in 1998, became a
    design icon and revived Apple's fortunes. In 2001, Apple introduced the iPod, a portable digital music player
    that revolutionized the music industry. It was followed by iTunes, an online music store, which became immensely
    popular.</p><br> 
    <p>
    <h3>The iPhone and iPad Era (2007-2010)</h3>
    In 2007, Apple launched the iPhone, a revolutionary smartphone that combined a mobile phone, an iPod, and
    internet communication capabilities. The iPhone's success transformed Apple into a dominant player in the mobile
    industry. In 2010, Apple released the iPad, creating a new product category of tablet computers.</p><br>
  <p>
    <h3>Post-Steve Jobs Era (2011-2019)</h3>
    In 2011, Steve Jobs passed away, but his legacy continued to shape Apple's direction. The company maintained its
    focus on innovative product design and introduced new iterations of the iPhone, iPad, and MacBook. It also
    launched services like iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple Pay.</p><br>
 <p>
    <h3>Recent Developments (2020-Present)</h3>
            Apple continued to expand its product lineup with the introduction of the Apple Watch, AirPods, and HomePod.
            It
            also diversified into services with the launch of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade. In 2020, Apple transitioned
            its
            Mac computers to custom-designed Apple Silicon chips, further integrating hardware and software
            capabilities.
            </p> <br>
          <h2>Marketing</h2> <br>
            <p><h3>Branding</h3> 
                According to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a fruitarian diet. Jobs thought the name "Apple" was "fun, spirited and not intimidating." Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were fans of the Beatles, but Apple Inc. had name and logo trademark issues with Apple Corps Ltd., a multimedia company started by the Beatles in 1968. This resulted in a series of lawsuits and tension between the two companies. These issues ended with the settling of their lawsuit in 2007.<br><br>
Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff's "rainbow Apple", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. On August 27, 1999, Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic logos nearly identical in shape to the previous rainbow incarnation.<br><br>
Apple evangelists were actively engaged by the company at one time, but this was after the phenomenon had already been firmly established. Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki has called the brand fanaticism "something that was stumbled upon," while Ive claimed in 2014 that "people have an incredibly personal relationship" with Apple's products. <br><br>
Fortune magazine named Apple the most admired company in the United States in 2008, and in the world from 2008 to 2012. On September 30, 2013, Apple surpassed Coca-Cola to become the world's most valuable brand in the Omnicom Group's "Best Global Brands" report. Boston Consulting Group has ranked Apple as the world's most innovative brand every year since 2005.<br> <br>
As of January 2021, there were 1.65 billion Apple products in active use. In February 2023 that number exceeded 2 billion devices. <br>
              </p><br>
 <p>
    <h3>Stores</h3>
The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers, and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997, and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so. <br> <br>

Over the years, Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage, with 499 stores across 22 countries worldwide as of December 2017. Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011. Apple Stores underwent a period of significant redesign, beginning in May 2016. This redesign included physical changes to the Apple Stores, such as open spaces and re-branded rooms, as well as changes in function to facilitate interaction between consumers and professionals. <br><br>

Many Apple Stores are located inside shopping malls, but Apple has built several stand-alone "flagship" stores in high-profile locations. It has been granted design patents and received architectural awards for its stores' designs and construction, specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes. The success of Apple Stores have had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers, who have lost traffic, control and profits due to a perceived higher quality of service and products at Apple Stores. Due to the popularity of the brand, Apple receives a large number of job applications, many of which come from young workers. Although Apple Store employees receive above-average pay, are offered money toward education and health care, and receive product discounts, there are limited or no paths of career advancement.

Market power
On March 16, 2020, France fined Apple €1.1 billion for colluding with two wholesalers to stifle competition and keep prices high by handicapping independent resellers. The arrangement created aligned prices for Apple products such as iPads and personal computers for about half the French retail market. According to the French regulators, the abuses occurred between 2005 and 2017 but were first discovered after a complaint by an independent reseller, eBizcuss, in 2012. <br><br>

On August 13, 2020, Epic Games, the maker of the popular game Fortnite, sued Apple and Google after its hugely popular video game was removed from Apple and Google's App Store. The suits come after both Apple and Google blocked the game after it introduced a direct payment system, effectively shutting out the tech titans from collecting fees. In September 2020 Epic Games founded the Coalition for App Fairness together with other thirteen companies, which aims for better conditions for the inclusion of apps in the app stores. Later in December 2020, Facebook agreed to assist Epic in their legal game against Apple, planning to support the company by providing materials and documents to Epic. Facebook had, however, stated that the company will not participate directly with the lawsuit, although did commit to helping with the discovery of evidence relating to the trial of 2021. In the months prior to their agreement, Facebook had been dealing with feuds against Apple relating to the prices of paid apps as well as privacy rule changes. Head of ad products for Facebook Dan Levy commented, saying that "this is not really about privacy for them, this is about an attack on personalized ads and the consequences it's going to have on small-business owners," commenting on the full-page ads placed by Facebook in various newspapers in December 2020.
